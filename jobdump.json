This position is based in our Washington newsroom.\n\nThe Post strives to provide its readers with high-quality, trustworthy news and information while constantly innovating. That mission is best served by a diverse, multi-generational workforce with varied life experiences and perspectives. All cultures and backgrounds are welcomed.\n\nHere are the roles:\n\u2022 Reporters: Clear, concise, energetic writing is highly valued. Conventional coverage of news events should be demonstrated, but a higher value is placed upon enterprise reporting that shows creative, inventive or investigative skills. Writing for the web is also highly valued. Please indicate your reporting assignment preference: General Assignments (includes National and Health & Science sections), Foreign (assignments will be in the Washington newsroom), Arts, Entertainment and Culture, Local, Sports or Editorial (will be assigned to the Opinions section). No more than three clips.\n\u2022 Visual Journalists: For digital photographers, candidates must be proficient in Photoshop CS, photo management software, and Mac and PC platforms. Your application must include a portfolio. Videographers must be proficient in all aspects of digital video/audio and editing software, including Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. Experience with voiceover narration and HTML is helpful. Required portfolio must be attached. Please indicate your assignment preference: Photography or Video.\n\u2022 Multiplatform Editors: Successful editors must be able to edit for multiple platforms, writing headlines that are tailored for print and digital audiences. Editors must also have a keen understanding of style, grammar and sentence structure, and must be able to edit for clarity. We also value editors who can detect problems in stories and work with others to make them better. Writing captions for photo galleries, proofing pages and the ability to work calmly under intense deadlines are also requirements, as is strong news judgment. Include up to six examples of news or feature stories you have edited, preferably files that include a headline and caption(s) for web or print.\n\u2022 Multiplatform Producers: The producer will be responsible for updating the web and mobile sites with fresh content and making sure article pages have critical web elements. We are looking for interns with solid news judgment, the ability to write smart headlines and blurbs and experience at packaging web stories, photo galleries and videos. An ideal candidate also will be adept at analyzing traffic data and web trends, understanding search engine optimization, be a quick and effective problem solver and be able to quickly learn to use new web publishing tools.\n\u2022 News and Digital Designers: The designers craft the visual presentations of our content across platforms. We are looking for interns capable of creating innovative storytelling presentations and then tailoring them to all of our platforms. A candidate must be a strong visual designer, able to work well on deadline and have experience working well with photography and video. They should be proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, and InDesign. Send a portfolio that includes five examples of your digital design work. The portfolio should be contained in one PDF or link on your application form.\n\u2022 Graphics Reporters and Developers: The graphics reporters and developers tell visual stories and present data on the web. A candidate should be able to utilize the entire storytelling toolbox - writing, reporting, charting, coding, mapping and data visualization - and know how to weave it all together to tell engaging stories. The candidate will create, or assist in creating, news applications such as data-driven maps, databases, social media apps, widgets and mobile tools that will either stand alone or be paired with other digital content. They will work closely with reporters and editors in the newsroom, either through mining existing data on the web, taking in feeds, or working with digital producers to imagine new ways to present information. They will work with the design and development team to indicate, design and help develop tools digital producers can use to enhance engagement. Candidates must be proficient in CSS(3), HTML(5), JQuery, JavaScript and must have experience in developing with databases, XML, JSON, PHP and/or Django. Send a portfolio that includes five to 10 examples of your work. The portfolio should be contained in one PDF or link on your application form.\n\u2022 Audience Producers: The producers on this team expand the reach of our storytelling and engagement with our journalism. We are looking for students who obsessively find ways to connect stories with readers. For instance, you may be a social media editor using Instagram Stories to break news, a newsletter writer responsible for a weekly email breaking down the biggest story, or a digital editor crafting the perfect web headline. Familiarity working in a web CMS, reading digital metrics, and analyzing reader habits is required. Please include two samples of native digital work you've produced (e.g. a tweet thread, newsletter, sharable graphic, website redesign, etc.) with your application.\n\u2022 Audio Producers: The producer helps record, write and edit audio stories for long-form and short-form podcasts, and works collaboratively with reporters and editors to find and bring to life Post reporting. The ideal candidate has a background in sound design, audio production or both. Our producers combine traditional journalistic skills with creative approaches to telling stories through sound. We also value a producer who brings creative approaches to promotion and community-building. Proficiency in either Adobe Audition or Pro Tools is required. Please include three links to audio clips with your application.\n\nThe Post strives to provide its readers with high-quality, trustworthy news and information while constantly innovating. That mission is best served by a diverse, multi-generational workforce with varied life experiences and perspectives. All cultures and backgrounds are welcomed.\n\nThe innovation doesn't end in the Newsroom - dozens of teams power The Washington Post. We are now hiring the next innovator - how will you Impact Tomorrow?\n\n#washpostlife",

        "description": "A World-Changing Company\n\nAt Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use their data. Our technology has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to... join us.\n\nThe Role\n\nForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir's platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like \"How do we evaluate wildfire risk and optimize a power grid as a result\" or \"How do we quickly assess our food supply chain and modify it to deliver life saving assistance on time?\" As an FDSE, you'll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You'll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world's most important industries and institutions.\n\nAs an FDSE Intern, your responsibilities look similar to those at a small startup, with the resources, stability and mentorship of an established tech company: You'll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team.\n\nFDSE Interns are treated just like full time engineers, with significant freedom and ownership over their work. Interns take responsibility for real world projects and outcomes that our customers rely on.\nOur Principles\n\u2022 Impact: We address meaningful and exciting projects that change the world for the better.\n\u2022 Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter. We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves.\n\u2022 Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds - such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and tackle their problems.\n\u2022 Growth: We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers and encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as fine new ways to innovate and share knowledge.\nWhat We Value\n\u2022 Ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal direction.\n\u2022 Engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science.\n\u2022 Proficiency with one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar.\n\u2022 Ability to collaborate in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\n\u2022 An eagerness to creatively solve technical problems with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n\u2022 Interest in working with and using large scale data to solve valuable business problems.\n\u2022 Willingness and interest to travel as needed to client sites. Ability to travel 25-50% preferred, but requirements vary by team and location.\n\u2022 Must be planning on graduating in 2024. This should be your final internship before graduating.\nRequirements\n\u2022 Willingness to undergo a US government background investigation, depending on US government project requirements.\nTo apply, please submit the following:\n\u2022 An updated resume / CV\n\u2022 Thoughtful responses to our application questions\nOffer Deadline\n\nIn an effort to build more transparency into our recruitment process, we'd like to share our offer deadline expectations. By applying to this position, you commit to confirming your decision within two weeks of receiving your written offer.\n\nPalantir is committed to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion and is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We believe that all Palantirians share the responsibility of upholding our commitment to these values and encourage candidates from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences to join us in solving the world's hardest problems. Palantir does not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics. Palantir is committed to working with and providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with physical and mental disabilities. Please see the United States Department of Labor's EEO poster and EEO poster supplement for additional information.\n\nPalantir is committed to making the job application process accessible to everyone.

        "description": "Medical Device Sales - Paid Internship\n\nLooking for a lucrative career in the medical sales industry...\n\nOrthopedic Surgical Sales could be for you!\n\u2022 Average income more than $190,000\n\u2022 Recession Proof\n\u2022 Work alongside surgeons in the operating room\n\u2022 #1 Professional Sales Career\n\nAt Medical Sales College we offer 8 and 12-week courses in various orthopedic device specialties. We take inexperienced candidates and train them for a career in medical device sales. Our career development team works directly with top orthopedic device companies to assist graduates in getting hired. After attending one of our programs and working with our team of industry experts, your chances of getting hired increase significantly, as seen with our job placement rate of over 90%.\n\nBENEFITS OF MEDICAL SALES COLLEGE:\n\u2022 10+ Years of history with more than 2,000 Job Placements\n\u2022 Over 90% Success Rate of Job Placement\n\u2022 2,000+ Employers registered exclusively with MSC\n\u2022 Largest recruiter in medical sales\n\nAs an alternative to immediately attending one of our programs we are offering a 12-month internship to join our team!\n\nThe ideal candidate must have the ability to relocate to Tampa, FL for the duration of the internship.\n\nINTERNSHIP OVERVIEW:\n\nAs critical members of the team, interns will start off by building phone skills and answering questions from prospective students while learning all about Medical Sales College. During phase two, interns will work alongside our industry experts to assist with building employer partnerships. This includes mapping hiring managers within assigned medical sales specialties. In the final months of the internship, interns will contribute to the promotion and growth of Medical Sales College by sourcing new sales opportunities through inbound lead follow-up and outbound phone calls, emails and texts.\n\nBENEFITS OF THE PAID INTERNSHIP:\n\nMedical Sales College is the only industry recognized training program that will replace the required orthopedic experience that employers demand for job consideration. During your time as an intern you will develop relationships with our internal industry experts and employers. This experience will drive your professional development and build a strong foundation in preparation for a career in medical device sales. You will be able to build your own network within the industry to accelerate your own career as a medical device representative. After successful completion of your internship, you will receive free tuition (value up to $16,000) and admittance into any one of our programs/campus locations. After completion of the internship and program, you will have the opportunity to enter the medical device industry anywhere in the U.S.\n\nIS AN INTERNSHIP REQUIRED TO ATTEND MSC?\n\nNo. Our goal at MSC is to find the most dedicated non-experienced candidates interested in medical device sales who need training and assistance with job placement. In some instances, a candidate may lack the necessary funding or professional experience required to attend Medical Sales College, and therefore would be a good fit for the internship.\n\nIDEAL CANDIDATE:\n\nThe internship is designed for those individuals with little to no prior work experience and who are seeking to grow professionally over a period of 12 months before entering the industry of medical device sales",

        "description": "Medical Device Sales - Paid Internship\n\nLooking for a lucrative career in the medical sales industry...\n\nOrthopedic Surgical Sales could be for you!\n\u2022 Average income more than $190,000\n\u2022 Recession Proof\n\u2022 Work alongside surgeons in the operating room\n\u2022 #1 Professional Sales Career\n\nAt Medical Sales College we offer 8 and 12-week courses in various orthopedic device specialties. We take inexperienced candidates and train them for a career in medical device sales. Our career development team works directly with top orthopedic device companies to assist graduates in getting hired. After attending one of our programs and working with our team of industry experts, your chances of getting hired increase significantly, as seen with our job placement rate of over 90%.\n\nBENEFITS OF MEDICAL SALES COLLEGE:\n\u2022 10+ Years of history with more than 2,000 Job Placements\n\u2022 Over 90% Success Rate of Job Placement\n\u2022 2,000+ Employers registered exclusively with MSC\n\u2022 Largest recruiter in medical sales\n\nAs an alternative to immediately attending one of our programs we are offering a 12-month internship to join our team!\n\nThe ideal candidate must have the ability to relocate to Tampa, FL for the duration of the internship.\n\nINTERNSHIP OVERVIEW:\n\nAs critical members of the team, interns will start off by building phone skills and answering questions from prospective students while learning all about Medical Sales College. During phase two, interns will work alongside our industry experts to assist with building employer partnerships. This includes mapping hiring managers within assigned medical sales specialties. In the final months of the internship, interns will contribute to the promotion and growth of Medical Sales College by sourcing new sales opportunities through inbound lead follow-up and outbound phone calls, emails and texts.\n\nBENEFITS OF THE PAID INTERNSHIP:\n\nMedical Sales College is the only industry recognized training program that will replace the required orthopedic experience that employers demand for job consideration. During your time as an intern you will develop relationships with our internal industry experts and employers. This experience will drive your professional development and build a strong foundation in preparation for a career in medical device sales. You will be able to build your own network within the industry to accelerate your own career as a medical device representative. After successful completion of your internship, you will receive free tuition (value up to $16,000) and admittance into any one of our programs/campus locations. After completion of the internship and program, you will have the opportunity to enter the medical device industry anywhere in the U.S.\n\nIS AN INTERNSHIP REQUIRED TO ATTEND MSC?\n\nNo. Our goal at MSC is to find the most dedicated non-experienced candidates interested in medical device sales who need training and assistance with job placement. In some instances, a candidate may lack the necessary funding or professional experience required to attend Medical Sales College, and therefore would be a good fit for the internship.\n\nIDEAL CANDIDATE:\n\nThe internship is designed for those individuals with little to no prior work experience and who are seeking to grow professionally over a period of 12 months before entering the industry of medical device sales",

Our focus is on equine reproduction and general health, prioritizing the individual horse and horse owner. The right individual will have drive, general horsemanship skills, and a desire to learn about general practice, mare... foal, and stallion management, and leveraging technology in modern veterinary practice.\n\nThe focus of the internship will be on learning and practicing general practice and equine reproductive skills and techniques. Crown 3 Equine does not have a boarded surgeon or surgical facility.\n\nCrown 3 Equine is a tight-knit team that focuses on employee health, teamwork, and maximal utilization of technicians and lay staff for increased efficiency in practice. During our busy breeding season, you will work hard, including overnight shifts and foaling care. The workload is spread across the entire team, including the practice owner, to allow for adequate rest as much as possible. Housing is provided.\n\nA DVM degree and license to practice in Texas is preferred, but not mandatory. Any individual who fits the general criteria and is enrolled in an accredited veterinary medical degree program will be considered.
